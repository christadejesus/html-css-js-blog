[View the live demo](https://christadejesus.github.io/html-css-js-blog/index.html)

A minimal blog built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript may not meet the usability and scalability needs of most clients, but this project is meant to showcase that it can be done!
## Highlights

- Built using HTML/CSS/JS only
- Responsive minimalist design
- Features reusable web components
- Single blog page with expandable posts
- Blog post previews for home page
- Previews link to corresponding articles

## Use Cases

- Informational articles for small static website
- Sample blog articles to supplement portfolio website
- Infrequently updated blog where the creator or staff has some coding knowledge

## Notes from the Developer

This HTML/CSS/JS blog is part of a portfolio demo series. Other blogs in this project feature technologies such as Markdown, React, Gatsby, Headless CMS, and more.

I am constantly incorporating new skills, refactoring, and adding to my projects. If you have any suggestions on how this project can be improved, please feel free to get in touch!
